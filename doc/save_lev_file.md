## Exporting to Liero level format (.lev file) in GIMP

Before going forward with exporting to .lev, be minded that if you're making
a map for use in WebLiero you can simply export as indexed PNG and call it a
day.
WebLiero doesn't even put a map size requirement when it's in PNG format, so
you can make a map of virtually any size.

The rest of this chapter is about exporting to .lev specifically.

### Checklist

Before exporting your Liero level it's important to make sure your image file
has the following characteristics:

* Indexed 256-color mode
* 504&times;350 image dimensions

If your file doesn't meet these criteria Liero will fail to load your exported
.lev file.

You don't need to worry about merging your layers down, GIMP will merge them on
its own when you export.

### Exporting

Go to `File` â†’ `Export As...`

![Export As...](/screenshots/export-as-menu.png)

In the Export Image dialog select `Raw image data` as the file type, and then
manually change the extension of your file to .lev.

NOTE: It's important to select the file type *before* you change the file
extension, as otherwise GIMP will change it back to .data.

Once you click `Export` GIMP will warn you that the file extension doesn't
match, click on `Save` anyway.

In the **Export Image as Raw Data** dialog leave all settings in their defaults
and click `Export`.

Now your .lev file is ready to load into Liero/WebLiero.
